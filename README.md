Trying to make a 2.0 iteration of my LDAP self service tool.


Use:
  activeldap
  sinatra



# Notes

## CLI
* Be able to authenticate (with or without a bind account)
* be able to logout on the CLI
* Be able to view other records if I am authenticated (for other users)

## Pass 2
* Be able to tell if I am an admin
* Be able to modify my own record
* If I am an amdin, be allowed to modify others (the directory might handle this)
